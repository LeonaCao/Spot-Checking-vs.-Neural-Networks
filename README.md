# Spot-Checking-vs.-Neural-Network

This is the last assignment during my Data Science course, where we were asked to build and fit models in both Spot Checking and Neural Network.

In this section I worked with weather data. For the spot check model, I am supposed to use lag variables.

On the other hand, for the neural network model, it was just a small beginning for me to learn its concepts and do the first hands-on experiment.

After building and fitting the two models, I compared their performances and feature importance through permutation testing.
